The Microsoft news dataset contains 4 separate tab-separated files: behaviors entity_embeddings, news and relation_embeddings. The main focus for now will be on behaviors and news, which gives us data on the catalog and users with interactions."

News contains information on the articles that users interact with like its ID, category, sub-category, title, abstract, url and some entities for use within embeddings (to my understanding). Behaviors focuses on impression ids, user ids, time, user history and impressions. Since there are two main datasets, we will be starting with some examination of each, and then examination of how they might interact."
