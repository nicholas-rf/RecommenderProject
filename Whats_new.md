# Whats new:

## Modelling:
Tensorflow model documentation for retrieval and ranking has been written so that we can write our own versions with the news dataset. Additionally I have started writing the docs for the sequential model which aims to predict the users next interaction item via RNN. There are more intermediate tensorflow tutorials on further feature extraction which I hope to get to sometime this week. 

## Data processing:
Not much on this front, the news dataset is in TSV format which doesn't contain columns, so I turned them into dataframes, added columns and exported as csv. 

## EDA:
I have started the EDA process by attempting to chart some intial distributions of categories and sub-categories in the news dataset. The current idea I had was to analyze the news and behavior datasets seperately at first, and then to analyze them within context of each other. Currently exploring data visualizations for attractive EDA.


## Potential: 
After we have an established model pipeline going and are able to truly experiment, there is a column in the news dataset that contains the urls to specific articles. This could be utilized for some sort of web-scraping and a language model to get some key information.
