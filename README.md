## Project outline
This serves as the final project for PSTAT 134/234 by Coby Wilcox and Nicholas Roze-Freitas. Our goal was to utilize the Microsoft News Dataset, MIND, to evaluate the efficacy of different recommender system frameworks ranging from state of the art like NVIDIA Merlin and Tensorflow, to classical implementations of ALS and SVD++. The main report can be read at ___, with supplementary materials contained in eda_report.ipynb, clustering_report.ipynb, and model_definitions.ipynb.
