    "Within baseline techniques is the utilization of a user-item matrix $R$, via clustering we were able to experiment on this. Three different types of the user-item ratings matrix $R$ were used for our baseline, two using either user or item clustering and one using both. By setting up $R$ in this way we increased the range of ratings and introduced collaboritve, content and hybrid filtering techniques in the models without them and enhanced those that did. "

Under SGD, we minimize the residuals found by $\\|R - V U^T\\|_F^2$ for observed values in $R$ using update functions for $U$ and $V$. In ALS, one latent factor matrix $U$ or $V$ fixed while the other is optimized with the process being alternated between $U$ and $V$ until convergence. To incorporate user features and item features past clustering, we experimented with adding these features to their respective latent factor matrices during runtime for the respective users and items in the clusters that are being evaluated.
